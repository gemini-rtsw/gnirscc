# Safe wrapper around rdist for deploying the CC build to /gemini/GEM5/...
#
# Rationale: plain rdist will happily mirror a build tree into whatever
# destination the tracked Distfile points at. A stale Distfile once caused
# a V1-24 build to be deployed over V1-21 on pisces, overwriting binaries
# and deleting ~220 dated data backups before it was caught. This script
# forces a human to confirm the source/destination and to re-confirm when
# the destination already has contents.
#
# Usage: ./tools/deploy.sh   (run from the CC repo root)
#
